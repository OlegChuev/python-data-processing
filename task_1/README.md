# Task 1

## Variant 14

## Title
Determining Flight Parameters of an Aircraft Using Track Data with Python Programming Language

## Objective of the Work
Develop skills in working with navigation data and determining the flight characteristics of an aircraft.

## Work Progress

Receive the flight track data according to the given variant.

Utilize the received track data to develop a Python software project for calculating the following values:
* Total flight route length
* Average flight speed, minimum and maximum flight speed
* Minimum and maximum flight altitude
* Total flight time

Present the results in the form of graphs depicting the dependency of flight speed on time, flight altitude on time, and distance traveled on time.


## Conclusion
Based on the obtained results, draw conclusions regarding the flight modes of the aircraft and the use of the Python programming language tools.
